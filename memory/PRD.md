# Divine Iris Healing - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a pixel-perfect clone of https://divineirishealing.com/ with comprehensive admin panel, robust enrollment system with anti-fraud India-gating, custom duration tiers, promotions/coupon system, geo-currency detection, and multi-program cart system.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic + Motor (async MongoDB)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Payments**: Stripe (TEST MODE) via emergentintegrations
- **Email**: Resend (configured, pending domain verification)

## What's Been Implemented

### Stripe Payment Fix (COMPLETED - Mar 11, 2026)
- [x] **"Invalid price" bug fixed** — checkout now passes tier_index + client_currency to server-side pricing
- [x] **Duration tier pricing** flows correctly through enrollment → OTP → Stripe checkout
- [x] **Multi-currency support** — Stripe receives correct amount in detected currency (USD/AED/INR)

### Per-Program Mode Toggles (COMPLETED - Mar 12, 2026)
- [x] **3 mode toggles per program**: Online (via Zoom), Offline (Remote, no in-person), In Person (default OFF, future)
- [x] **Admin Panel**: 3 styled checkboxes with descriptions replace old mode dropdown; badges in program list
- [x] **Homepage**: Cards show only enabled mode badges (blue=Online, purple=Offline, green=In Person). Disclaimer when In Person is OFF
- [x] **Enrollment Page**: Only enabled modes appear as attendance options with descriptions (e.g., "via Zoom", "Remote, no in-person")
- [x] **Cart Page**: Same conditional mode buttons from CartContext data
- [x] **Backend**: enable_online, enable_offline, enable_in_person fields on Program model

### Discounts Frontend Display Fix (COMPLETED - Mar 12, 2026)
- [x] **Cart Page** — Shows Combo Discount (green line) when 2+ programs, Group Discount when 3+ participants
- [x] **Cart Checkout Page** — Full discount breakdown (group, combo, loyalty, promo) in order summary with reduced total
- [x] **Enrollment Page** — Group Discount and Loyalty Discount lines in price summary sidebar

- [x] **Combo Discount** — Auto-discount when 2+ programs in cart (configurable % and min programs)
- [x] **Loyalty Program** — Auto-discount for returning clients with existing UID (configurable %)
- [x] **Backend API** — GET /api/discounts/settings, POST /api/discounts/calculate, GET /api/discounts/check-loyalty/{email}
- [x] **Conditional referral** — Enrollment and Cart pages conditionally show referral section based on admin toggle

### UID System, Referral, Cart Discount Fix, 32 Countries (COMPLETED - Mar 12, 2026)
